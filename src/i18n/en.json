I play table tennis in a team, a sport that has taught me mutual support, working together toward a common goal, and progressing individually at the same time. I also play chess (online), a discipline that strengthens my concentration, my ability to calculate several moves ahead, and to consider multiple possibilities instead of getting stuck on a single scenario.",
    "description3": "I also enjoy reading, especially novels; I even recommend “La promesse de l’aube” by Romain Gary, a book that left a strong impression on me. Finally, I’m a loyal supporter of the Racing Club de Lens: I love the idea of supporting the team and its players no matter what, through difficult moments as well as moments of glory."
